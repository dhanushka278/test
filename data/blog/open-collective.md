# OpenCollective

Electron recently started an [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/electron) for collecting and distributing donations. The project is fortunate enough to have many full-time contributors both inside and outside of GitHub. 

Yet there is an ever-growing list of applications using Electron to do awesome things. Many of you already know Atom, but Electron now backs Skype, Visual Studio Code, Atlassian’s Stride, Trello, Discord, Signal, WhatsApp, GitHub Desktop, Figma, and over [500 more apps listed on our website](https://electronjs.org/apps).

Each app has unique needs. We have introduced a strict [versioning policy](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-versioning) to allow for smoother updates, but despite many active contributors, not everyone’s needs are met.

A full-time contributor is extremely costly. A few organizations have approached us about sponsoring smaller amounts of work. In response, we have created an OpenCollective for pooling and distributing funds directed towards a long-tail of awaiting work.

We want a process that is lightweight, but provides transparency through checks and balances. OpenCollective is a great balance of these needs. All costs coming in and going out are transparent and available for anyone to see. We can accept large and small donations, including one-time or recurring.

Want people to be able to direct what work their funding goes towards, but we also don't want to spend more time deciding how to spend the money than it’s worth. As such, we drew a line in the sand at $10,000 USD per year.

Folks donating over $10k annually have complete oversight of their funds. If they want their money to go 100% towards bug-bounties, we will accommodate that. If they want their money to go 50% towards security work, and 50% towards performance, we will accommodate that.

For donations under $10k annually, the money goes into a general fund. The allocations of the general fund will be decided together as a group donors will have input, but not total control.

If you're interested in submitting a large donation, please email info@electronjs.org with `OpenCollective` in your subject line.
